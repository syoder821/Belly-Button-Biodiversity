# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
The purpose of this project is to create a web page dashborad that displays biodiversity data for each voluteer for improved visualization. The voluteer data is contained in the data file samples.json.  Java sript and HTML code to generate the dashboard are contained in the charts.js and index.html files.  The panel contains the demographic information for each voluteer based on the ID selected in the dropdown menu.  The test subject's ID number is selected using the drop down menu to explore the interactive charts for washing frequencey, top 10 cultures found, and the type of cultures found per sample. The volunteers are be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if a species is identified as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
